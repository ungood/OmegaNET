Omega.NET is an open source .NET library for the ALPHA line of LED signs made by Adaptive Micro Systems.

Not to be confused with AlphaNET, which is the official software for controlling the signs and costs $$$.

It is based loosely on the BetaBrite API by Jeff Atwood found here: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/vb/BetaBriteAPI.aspx
